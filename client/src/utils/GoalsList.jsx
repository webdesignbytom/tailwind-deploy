        title: 'Save People Money',
        content: "Since the government has no intention to prevent energy companies from charging extortionate amounts, we feel we can generate good will for the environment by helping people living in it. We intend to give the entire solar set ups away and save families thousands each year. Not only that each family we help will generate more good will for our business and increase our traffic and therefore earnings.",

        title: 'Build Wildlife Areas',
        content: "To help the planet we can't just help people produce energy. We need to help every creature that lives here to keep the life cycle turning. England loses huge amounts of hedgerows, grasslands and wetlands every yeat to build ugly concrete structures. We plan to reclaim areas which are unlivable and turn them into parks specifically designed for animals to live and find fruits to feed from.",
